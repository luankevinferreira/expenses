# Privacy Policy for Expenses

**Last updated: May 22, 2024**

Luan Kevin Ferreira ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Expenses mobile application (the "App").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The App is designed to be used offline. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data to external servers. All data you enter into the App (such as expenses, descriptions, and categories) is stored locally on your device.

### Types of Data Collected

*   **Personal Data:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number).
*   **Usage Data:** We do not collect information on how the App is accessed and used.

## 2. Data Storage

All information recorded in the App is stored locally on your device's internal storage using a SQLite database. This data remains on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.

If you delete the App, the data stored within it will also be deleted, unless your device's backup system (e.g., Google Backup) has saved a copy of the App's data.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services that collect information used to identify you.

## 4. Permissions

The App may request certain permissions to function correctly. These permissions are used solely for the App's core functionality and do not involve the collection of personal data.

*   **Internal Storage:** Used to store and retrieve your expense data locally.

## 5. Security of Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Since all data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
